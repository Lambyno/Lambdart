My first short manga series that explores artistic expressions from personal childhood stories. The title was taken from Attila József's poem "Levegőt!'', the theme of which is not specifically related to the theme of the manga, only this question itself taken out of context. This little creature, who is called Tupi, is someone or something inexplicable who mysteriously flows in the thoughts, feelings and life of the girl. We don’t know when he showed up or if he's always been there to begin with. A friendly-looking little figure with a neutral expression on his face who is always around you whether if you want to or don't.  How can you react to something which is so emotionally and mentally complicated, which is just can't be explained and just bound to be exist?

Heyho!

I'm an aspiring art student in a university studying Graphics Art on a masters degree. I also have 4 years of basic Visual Arts (sculpting, painting, printmaking, drawing etc.) highschool degree with 2 years of graphics art/printmaking specialization.

My interests are Character Design, Digital Illustration/Painting in the style of mixing anime/manga styles with realism/semi-realism and making manga. I tend to be experimental at times and I'm open to different art styles.

Currently I'm trying to improve as much as I can; build relationships, do commissions/freelance jobs and keep adding to my portfolio to make it look as professional as I can.
